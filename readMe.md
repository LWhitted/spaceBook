spaceBook is a site where you can login by entering a profile and freely post your thoughts for others to see.

the structure of our site:
-initial profile page
-that directs you to the "posts" page where you can create posts, view your post history, add posts to favorites, or delete your past posts
-there is a nav bar that can direct you to: the initial page, favorites page, and your about me page
-the favorites page shows all of your favorite posts
-the aboutme page shows the information you submitted on the initial page

pain points:
we wanted to add an alert message with the delete button. We are having issues with it so we are commenting it out for now.
we are having issues with the favorites button. We are having issues with the data populating in the database and the favorites page.
